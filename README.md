Simple snake game
=================
First git repo test program
## Overview:
Acts like the classic Snake game. Arrow keys and *WASD* are valid keys for moving the Snake. Snake will always start in the top left corner with a length of 3 and will make its first move in the down direction. The game will begin and the snake will start moving when the user presses any movement key. Users can **RESTART** with the *ESC* key while the snake is moving. If the snake is not moving then the *ESC* will destroy the window and quit the program. 

## Configurable constants:
Within **Main** one may modify any of the following:
* **GAMETIME**
* **SNAKE_HEAD_COLOUR**
* **SNAKE_COLOUR**
* **FOOD_COLOUR**
